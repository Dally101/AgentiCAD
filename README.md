## 🌟 **Vision & Mission**

### **💡 The Inspiration**

In today's rapidly evolving world, brilliant product ideas often remain trapped in the minds of inventors, entrepreneurs, and creators who lack the technical expertise or resources to bring them to life. Traditional product development requires expensive CAD software, engineering knowledge, manufacturing connections, and significant time investment - barriers that exclude millions of innovators.

**AgentiCAD was born from a simple yet powerful vision**: *What if anyone could transform their product idea into a manufacturable prototype in minutes, not months?*

### **🎯 Our Mission**

**Democratize product innovation** by making professional-grade product design accessible to everyone - from students with breakthrough ideas to entrepreneurs launching startups, from makers in their garages to designers in developing countries.

### **🔮 The Vision**

We envision a world where:
- **Ideas flow freely** from concept to prototype without technical barriers
- **AI serves as a design partner**, understanding your vision and enhancing it with engineering expertise
- **Manufacturing becomes accessible**, connecting creators directly with production capabilities
- **Innovation accelerates globally**, enabling the next generation of world-changing products

- **Code editor** (VS Code recommended)

### **⚡ 1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dally101/AgentiCAD.git
cd AgentiCAD
```

### **📦 2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### **🔑 3. Environment Configuration**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

### **🌐 4. Set Up Supabase (Database & Auth)**

1. **Create a Supabase project**:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Click "Start your project" 
   - Create new organization and project

2. **Get your Supabase credentials**:
   - Go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

3. **Add to your `.env` file**:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. **Run database migrations**:
```bash
npx supabase db reset
```

### **🤖 5. Configure AI Services (Pica API)**

AgentiCAD uses Pica for secure AI service access. You have two options:

#### **Option A: Free Tier (Recommended for testing)**
```env
# Add these test keys to your .env file
VITE_PICA_SECRET_KEY=your_pica_secret_key
VITE_PICA_OPENAI_CONNECTION_KEY=your_openai_connection
VITE_PICA_GEMINI_CONNECTION_KEY=your_gemini_connection  
VITE_PICA_ELEVENLABS_CONNECTION_KEY=your_elevenlabs_connection
```

#### **Option B: Direct API Keys (Advanced)**
If you prefer direct API integration, you can modify the service to use:
- OpenAI API key directly
- Google AI Studio API key  
- ElevenLabs API key

### **💳 6. Stripe Configuration (Optional)**

For payment processing:

1. **Create Stripe account** at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. **Get your keys** from the Stripe Dashboard
3. **Add to `.env`**:
```env
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
```

### **🎯 7. Run the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
